\description{
Internal function for cv_sparsity
}
\details{
This function finds the most sparse combination of keepx and keepy (min(keepx/p + keepy/q)) that yields cov(T,U) within 1 std error of the largest cov(T,U). Note that it's possible that the resulting keepx or keepy is larger than the orignal when p >> q or p << q.
